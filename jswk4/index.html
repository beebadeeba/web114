    <h1>Check Your Favorite Month (Open Console with F12)</h1>

    <h2>Question:</h2>
    <p><strong>When would you use a switch statement in your projects?</strong></p>
    <p>
        A switch statement is best used when you need to compare one variable against several
        possible values. It helps make your code cleaner and more organized than multiple
        if/else if statements, especially when each case leads to a distinct outcome.
    </p>

    <h2>Exercise:</h2>
    <p>
        Open the browser console (press <strong>F12</strong> or right-click → Inspect → Console)
        to test the "Favorite Month Checker" program.
