  <h1>JavaScript Mini-Game</h1>
<p id="statusText">
    This project is a simple browser-based game, created for my WEB 114 final. I chose to make this game because the assignment was to create an interactive webpage to demonstrate the skills
    we learned this semester. This game takes into account everything i've learned in ALL my classes this semester, including personal studying I did from independent Javascript sources. 
</p>
  <h1>Why I Chose This Game</h1>
<p>
    I wanted to build something that I could show off to my friends and family, and I wanted something more engaging than just tic-tac-toe or a calculator. 
</p>
  <h1>This Project Includes</h1>
<p>
    I think overall this project is a great endpoint for this semester, showcasing the experience I gained in fundamentals of front-end development. Even though the game is quite simple
    it combines everything I have practiced and showcases how Javascript can transform a website.
